Paper:
=======================================
>> Place all unfinished hardware improvements in "recommendations" section

Server: (note: * = optional)
=======================================
>> create mobile app*
>> change the way messages are parsed ; moderate to complete overhaul required (done)
  - currently case insensitive (done)
>> find alternative to sha256 encryption
>> overhaul scheduled feeding parsing
  - type 1: intervals
  - type 2: specific time
  - fix front end accordingly
>> implement texting of users regarding feed estimate warnings
  - add option: warn me when I have insufficient feed for (timespan)

Website:
=======================================
>> implement profile tab (done)
  - add edit profile option (done)
>> implement delete unit option (done)
>> implement add fish sample button on unit page
>> implement deeper statistical analysis of fish sampling
  - ave size, weight, population (estimate), etc 
>> implement harvest function
  - tallies costs and, with user input on estimated sales (price of fish per kilo x kilos harvested), provides net profit/income
  - merge with revamped fish sampling stats page?
>> implement feed financial data tab
  - feed name*
  - cost per kilo
  - total amount on hand
    - total used every (timespan)
  - which field units/fish pens use this feed*
>> make unit state whether it is currently online or offline
  - every n minutes, server will call the units. if the call is not answered, switch unit status to offline and text a warning to the user.

>> interval: check if total hours between start time and end time is divisible by interval time; adjust form maximum accordingly
>> finish register.html
  - implement client-side checking of inputs
  - black box testing
  - rework css
>> finish server.js
  - implement server-side checking of inputs
  - test
>> make website responsive
>> overhaul css
>> implement/fix error warning texts (i.e. wrong password etc)

Field Unit: (note: * = optional)
=======================================
>> troubleshoot GSM module
>> send error message to user
>> buy own 220v to 12v universal adaptor
>> replace nails with woodscrews*
>> weatherproof prototype*
  - encase solenoid valve
  - cover exposed wires
>> add actual handles on chassis*
>> add straps/mounts for other parts for easy transpo when not assembled*
