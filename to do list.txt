Paper:
=======================================
>> Place all unfinished hardware improvements in "recommendations" section

Software:
=======================================
>> find free alternative to diafaan
>> change the way messages are parsed ; moderate to complete overhaul required
  - no spaces allowed for field unit labels
  - currently case insensitive (problem for labels, not commands)
>> include feed amount left in server response to feed command
>> improve web server CSS

Hardware: (note: all optional)
=======================================
>> buy own 220v to 12v universal adaptor
>> weatherproof prototype
  - encase solenoid valve
  - cover exposed wires
>> add actual handles on chassis
>> add straps/mounts for other parts for easy transpo when not assembled
